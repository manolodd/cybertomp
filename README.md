## CyberTOMP

**CyberTOMP** (Cybersecurity Tactical and Operational Management Process) is a comprehensive and systematic framework designed to manage **asset-focused cybersecurity** from the **tactical and operational levels** of an organization. It bridges the gap left by traditional high-level cybersecurity standards—such as ISO 27001 or NIST CSF, which often lack detailed procedures for lower organizational layers. CyberTOMP provides a **methodological and procedural foundation** that complements these strategic frameworks, enabling consistent and holistic cybersecurity management across departments. The framework introduces structured processes, standardized metrics, and a unified list of expected outcomes (ULEO) to quantitatively assess cybersecurity performance. It emphasizes **strategic alignment**, **holism**, and **unity of action**, empowering organizations to dynamically adapt to evolving cyber threats while maintaining a clear focus on protecting critical business assets and ensuring continuity of operations.

Although the **CyberTOMP framework** can be applied in private-sector environments, it is **especially designed and particularly useful for public organizations**, which often face strong **structural compartmentalization into silos**, a **high dependence on outsourced technical services**, and a **complex supply chain**. CyberTOMP addresses these challenges by incorporating **specific mechanisms** that facilitate coordination across functional areas, ensure holistic cybersecurity management, and integrate supply chain dependencies into tactical and operational decision-making
